Socks5
======

A full-fledged performance socks5 proxy server written in C#. Plugin support included.

-- Plugin Instructions --

With plugins, you can currently do the following:
- Handle connections to the socks5 server and block by IP.
- Handle/Require a login for the Socks5 proxy.
- Handle/Modify incoming and outgoing data.
- Handle/Modify incoming connections, and rewrite them to different domains/addresses & ports.

I plan to add more for plugins later.

More plugins are planned to be added on later.

-- Included in this Branch --

Socks5 and Socks5_Minimal.
Socks5 Minimal is a socks5 server with no plugin support, and is a lot better performing as well as smaller in size.
