Socks5
======

A full-fledged performance socks5 proxy server written in C#. Plugin support included.

-- Plugin Instructions --

With plugins, you can currently do the following:
- Handle/Require a login for the Socks5 proxy.
- Handle/Modify incoming and outgoing data.

I plan to add more for plugins later.
